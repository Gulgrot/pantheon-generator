Accept death, but never apathy
Breathe peace into battlefields
Build bridges where others burn them
Celebrate loss and memory equally
Cherish the useless
Defend the weak with fury
Deny no one shelter
Do not envy, do not scorn
Do not turn from the mirror
Embrace change as sacred
Feed the hungry before the rich
Follow the storm to its source
Forgive those who kneel
Give joy as freely as water
Give no gift without intent
Guard what is sacred
Honor each sunrise with a breath
Honor the animal within
Lend your hands to the fallen
Let no oath go unfulfilled
Let silence speak first
Let your footsteps leave blessings
Listen more than you speak
Look to the stars and dream
Love the story before the end
Protect the old stones
Punish pride with humility
Raise the young in wonder
Remember the forgotten
Respect names and their power
Sacrifice what you love for the greater good
Shelter the fearful before the brave
Sing at the edge of battle
Spare the blade, but never the truth
Speak truth in darkness
Stand as stone against cruelty
Strike when others wait
Take no life without purpose
Teach before you command
Tend to the garden of the world
Trust not those who wear masks
Welcome the stranger
Worship with deeds, not words
