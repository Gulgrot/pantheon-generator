Became one with the river
Became the sea after being shattered
Birthed shadows to cradle light
Bled stars across the firmament
Bound chaos with laughter
Broke the world to remake it
Built a mountain from regrets
Carried a mountain on their shoulders
Danced with time until it fractured
Died three times and returned each time
Died to bring the world color
Drank the moonlight until they wept
Fell endlessly and called it grace
Fell in love with a storm
Forged the sun from their own heart
Fought the night for ten thousand years
Gambled with fate and won
Gave names to all the beasts
Grew a forest from their bones
Held the sun in their palm
Hid their name inside every flame
Laughed in the face of gods
Let their sorrow drown the plains
Lost themselves in a mirror and returned new
Rode a comet to the stars
Sang lullabies to volcanoes
Shattered the sky to end a war
Shed tears that became the first river
Slept for a thousand years and dreamed the seasons
Split their heart to form the seasons
Spoke one word that made the world kneel
Spoke to the sky and made it listen
Stole fire and was never forgiven
Swallowed the moon in mourning
Taught mortals the first word
Taught the wolves to sing
Traded eyes with a serpent for wisdom
Tricked the gods into forgetting them
Turned into stone after witnessing mortal sorrow
Turned their enemies into constellations
Walked across the ocean without getting wet
Was betrayed by their twin and cast into the void
Wrestled death to save a child
Wrote their story into the wind
